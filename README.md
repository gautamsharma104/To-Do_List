# To-Do_List
We use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this Project. The HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) will help us to create the structure for the list with some necessary attributes and elements.

Then we will use CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) which will help us to style or design the project with suitable padding and alignment. At last, we will use JS (JavaScript) which will add logic to make the project responsive from the user end.
